This is the version 2.0 of love-diary. Main change is migrate data from Deta to airtable.

This project is a "social" app I made for my love.

Obviously the only users are me and her.

It's a multiple functional app but the main purpose is to write and share diary with each other.

We can write diarys or blogs, post images, make comments.

It also help record our big days.

It's a PWA so that it can be run without internet connection!
